                   <h3> Address IoT implementation challenges</h3><br>
                    Edge IoT and analytics can provide a powerful mechanism for translating complex data sources into a
                    streamlined, lower-cost platform with faster ROI and higher value. However, there are five key
                    challenges businesses face when considering an IoT implementation.

                        <img class="bd-placeholder-img bd-placeholder-img-lg featurette-image img-fluid mx-auto" 
                             src="3.jpg">
        
                    </div>
                    <br>
                   <h3> 1. Investment</h3>
                    The transformational potential of IoT across multiple industries is staggering and much has been
                    discussed about its power to revolutionize business models. But, while the possibilities for market
                    sectors are hugely exciting, the reality of many of these industry IoT offerings is that they are
                    designed for vast use cases -- the setups are intricate and complex, with incredibly powerful
                    networking capabilities that require significant investment and skill to execute.

                    The major players in the IoT space, including AWS and Microsoft, require huge upfront investment
                    into IoT stacks and other hardware integrated into the data center, as well as personnel who can
                    code the solution, write it and build it -- that's potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars even
                    before an organization gains potential data or insight.

                    ROI is something that the IoT space lacks, causing proof of concepts to fail. One early use case for
                    IoT -- smart meters -- is an instance where it's simple to work out the ROI as organizations don't
                    have to send meter readers to sites and there is an immediate cost benefit.

                    But, with IIoT, it's much more than that. Perhaps, it exposes some savings, and maybe less machine
                    maintenance is required. Savings are harder to identify at the outset; therefore, large upfront
                    investment in that kind of solution is difficult to justify under those circumstances.
                    <div class="col-md-5 ">
                        <img class="bd-placeholder-img bd-placeholder-img-lg featurette-image img-fluid mx-auto" 
                             src="tech-2.jpg">
        
                    </div><br>

                    <h3>2. Rip and replace</h3>
                    In a lot of industrial cases, the existing machinery that requires monitoring includes large,
                    complex and expensive structures. These machines are suited and built for the task at hand, and for
                    that reason, they should be monitored in a noninvasive way.

                    Many facilities have been designed and built at the cost of billions of dollars, and organizations
                    can't start ripping and replacing components because cloud-enabled technology provides a benefit
                    that hasn't been quantified yet.

                    Conversely, many of the IoT offerings out there from the market depend on IoT being built into
                    infrastructure from the start -- a concept that could result in significant business disruption and
                    downtime.
                    <div class="col-md-5 ">
                        <img class="bd-placeholder-img bd-placeholder-img-lg featurette-image img-fluid mx-auto" 
                             src="tech-1.jpg">
        
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <h3>3. Little Bits</h3>
                    The skill set that is required to manage these types of complex setups is also a significant hurdle
                    for many organizations. A high proportion of IoT customers in manufacturing are not necessarily
                    IT-savvy in the way that traditional database users are. With many providers that require someone
                    that can effectively manage these platforms, this is an issue that is damaging the chances of
                    adoption in that sector.

                    Businesses need a way to get data out of the IoT devices without the complex ecosystem that
                    surrounds them through a streamlined platform that only needs a browser to access. This means that
                    organizations must figure out if they can afford to hire a dedicated IoT professional and how that
                    role can provide value.
